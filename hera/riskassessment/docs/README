Tenberge Threshold correction. 
------------------------------

When using the Tenberge model 

	\begin{equation}
		T_L = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} C^n dt 
	\end{equation}

We have to correct the Toxic levels. accoding to the following procedure. 

1. Calculate the concentration in which the Dose was estimated. In our case it would 
   usually be in a constant concentration for 2 min. 

  \begin{equation}
	C = \frac{D}{2[min]}
  \end{equation}

2. Now calculate the new Dose by substituting in the tenberge equation: 
   \begin{equation} 
	2[min]*C^n = 2[min]\left(\frac{D}{2[min]}\right)^n = T_L
   \end{equation}

  This procedure was also documented in A comparative analysis of tocivy models. Weinrich SL, Lawrence AE, Burr JK. IDA, 2008
  

3. Correct the probit. Numerical experiments (the code in python/HaberToBerge.py) show that the 
   new probig is the old one divided by n. 



The values of GB were modified.
