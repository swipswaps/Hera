Instructions for developers
===========================

Synchronize intermediate version
--------------------------------

In order to synchronize the code with another user
just type::

git pull origin [developer name]

In order to avoid conflicts, you can either accept their version::

git pull origin [developer name] -X theirs

or force your own version::

git pull origin [developer name] -X ours
